    <h3>Steps to follow</h3>
        <p>Warm up some olive oil in a pot and add the carrots, the onion, and the garlic, letting them fry for a couple of minutes. Add the lentils in the pot and stir to cover them with oil, which will help open their pores and get more taste out of them. Pour the vegetable stock and the yoghurt, and let the mix simmer for 15-20 minutes on low heat. Season it with salt and pepper, add lemon juice to taste and then put the mix in a blender for a more creamy texture.</p>
